        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>Every man has a story to tell but not everyone gets an opportunity to tell it early in their life. I, Amrit
            Ashu, final year student at RV College Of Engineering,Bengaluru express through this medium my life between
            coming as an innocent kid from a small town in Jharkhand to leaving the college as a humble, curious and
            confident person knowing my own road to success.
            <br>
            I came to Bangalore as a 17 year old kid from Bokaro Steel City, a small town in Jharkhand.After searching
            for the list of best engineering colleges in India numerous times, my father decided upon RVCE. I entered
            the 63 acre campus with my father constantly asking me if I would be able to live alone, and me, constantly
            giving him a concerned look.There were students all around , some coming out from classes conversing with
            teachers, some mingling with their friends , some sitting alone fallen deep into their thoughts. As I saw
            them I wondered, which of the these categories would I fall into.
            When I entered the hostel and saw my room, I was horrified, a room where 3 beds would fit with great
            difficulty. A hospital bed lookalike was allotted to me as well and there were two other room mates , one
            from Karnataka and the other from Andhra Pradesh.The first question that came to my mind was how would I
            mingle with two people from completely different cultures speaking different languages, but then as destiny
            is, that was the beginning of a never-ending friendship.
            I had earlier heard a lot of negativity about mess food and was very worried about it as well, when I tasted
            Set Dosa for the first time, I felt that mess food is not that bad. It is just that when you get habituated
            to one kind of food , you get bored of it. My father gave me a very important advice after tasting the food,
            he told the food that does not taste nice is healthy food. It was a great day, got an opportunity to meet
            lot of new people, people who came from various parts of the country. The next day was our first class, all
            excited I went to class, it didnâ€™t take me long to understand that there was a huge diversity of students,
            in terms of culture, in terms of financial background, and definitely in terms of interest towards
            engineering.
            We met a few seniors, gave introductions, got to understand how to make fun of each other and how to defend
            ourselves, some of the important learnings of engineering came from these introductions. Exams were always a
            special part, completing a syllabus taught for 4 months in a single night was something we were proud of
            doing.Earlier everyone used to be worried about the marks and GPA, but later we understood that GPA was just
            an eligibility barrier for placements and higher education and nothing more.
